            <h2>About the Sardar Dulli Community</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to the Sardar Dulli Community</h3>
            <p>The Sardar Dulli community is a significant tribal group claiming Mughal ancestry, closely linked to the Barlas Mughals. They primarily reside in Azad Kashmir, especially in Bagh District, with smaller populations in Kotli District and parts of Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>
            <h3>Historical Background</h3>
            <h4>Mughal Roots</h4>
            <p>According to historical accounts, the Dooldai tribe, from which the Dulli community descends, originated in Central Asia. The tribe traces its lineage back to Turk, the ancestor of Turkic and Mongol tribes, and Mughal Khan, a pivotal figure in their genealogy.</p>
            <h4>Migration to India</h4>
            <p>The community’s connection to India began with Sultan Mehmood, a nobleman who accompanied Emperor Babur during his conquest of India. After Babur’s establishment of the Mughal Empire, Sultan Mehmood's descendants settled in Delhi, adopting the name Dooldi.</p>
            <h4>Displacement During Sher Shah Suri's Reign</h4>
            <p>Following the overthrow of Emperor Humayun by Sher Shah Suri, the Dooldi Mughals faced persecution and migrated to Poonch under the Chak Dynasty of Kashmir. Shams Douli, a prominent figure among them, gained prominence at the Chak court, establishing the community as influential landowners.</p>
            <h3>Tribal Traditions</h3>
            <p>The Dulli community believes their ancestor, Nawab-ud-Doula, was a descendant of Tamerlane, connecting them to the powerful Barlas Mughals. Historical records also mention Douldai chiefs who ruled parts of Iran and Khorasan before joining Babur’s campaign in India.</p>
            <h3>Prominent Dulli Families</h3>
            <h4>Sardars of Chandak</h4>
            <p>The Chandak Sardars, an influential Dulli family in Indian-administered Poonch, rose to prominence during Sikh rule. Akbar Ali Khan established a semi-independent base, later succeeded by his son Sarmast Khan under Dogra rule.</p>
            <h4>Sardars of Dara Sher Khan</h4>
            <p>Another prominent Dulli family hailed from Dara Sher Khan village, named after Sher Khan Douli, a notable figure during Gulab Singh Dogra’s reign.</p>
